# Pi project config (`.pi/`)

Project-local configuration for [pi](https://pi.dev) agent sessions in this
repository — the umbrella twin of `charly/.pi/` (see `HARNESS-PARITY.md`).
Pi auto-loads `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` as context, and loads the OpenCharly skill
corpus as a pi PACKAGE — `git:github.com/opencharly/marketplace` in `settings.json`
below, installed automatically at startup after the project is trusted (the
marketplace repo's root `package.json` declares the `pi` resource with a
`./*/skills` glob). This directory also gives pi the one thing the other
harnesses get from their own plugin systems: a **hooks system**.

## What's here

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `settings.json` | Registers the project extension and the project pi packages. |
| `extensions/umbrella-gates.ts` | Pi's equivalent of the `.reasonix`/kimi `PreToolUse(Bash)` wiring of `.claude/hooks/pre-commit-gate.sh` + `pre-push-gate.sh`. Intercepts every `bash` tool call and blocks commands the gates reject (force-push, direct push to `main`, `--no-verify` commit bypass, untokenizable commits). Also injects the umbrella rulebook into the system prompt every turn and provides `umbrella_load_skills`. |
| `prompts/` | Slash prompts: `sync` (gitlink sync flow), `pr-body`, `rulebook`, `skill`, `subagent-review`, `subagent-verify`. |
| `subagents/umbrella-agents.json` | reviewer / worker / validator sub-agents, scoped to the umbrella's policies. |

## Project packages

`settings.json` pins the following pi packages (installed automatically on
startup after the project is trusted):

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pi-mcp-adapter` | 2.26.1 | MCP (Model Context Protocol) adapter extension for Pi. |
| `pi-subagents` | 0.51.0 | Single-agent delegation and scripted multi-agent workflows. |
| `@narumitw/pi-plan-mode` | 0.49.3 | Codex-like read-only `/plan` collaboration mode. |
| `@juicesharp/rpiv-todo` | 2.6.2 | A todo list for the model, rendered as a live overlay that survives `/reload` and compaction. |
| `pi-memory` | 0.4.2 | Memory with qmd-powered semantic search across daily logs, long-term memory, and scratchpad. |
| `pi-ollama-cloud` | 0.9.0 | Ollama Cloud provider plugin (also installed at the user level). |

Versions are pinned for reproducibility; `pi update --extensions` skips pinned
packages. Move a package to a newer ref with `pi install npm:<pkg>@<new-ver>`.

> **Security:** pi packages run with full system access and their extensions
execute arbitrary code. Review a package's source before adding it to a shared
project config.

## Why this is needed

The project rulebook (`AGENTS.md` "Hooks doctrine") mandates that deterministic
git-workflow command mechanics — bypass flags, force-push, direct-main push,
untokenizable commit commands — are enforced by hooks. Claude Code, reasonix,
and kimi wire `.claude/hooks/*.sh` for this. Pi has no built-in hooks system,
so this extension reproduces that wiring through pi's `tool_call` event,
running the exact same gate scripts.

The gates guard mechanics only. Attribution, change class, policy-B equality,
and rulebook compliance are judged by the fresh `pr-validator` at merge, never
by the extension.

## Trust

Pi asks before trusting a project that contains project-local resources (like
this `.pi/`). Trust it once with `/trust` (interactive) or `--approve`/`-a`
(non-interactive) so the extension loads.
