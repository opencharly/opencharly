#!/usr/bin/env bash
# PreToolUse(Bash) gate for `git push` — a DISCIPLINE BACKSTOP, not a security
# boundary (GitHub branch protection is the authority). It blocks (exit 2) a
# push that:
#   - force-pushes (--force / --force-with-lease / -f) — forbidden on EVERY
#     branch in EVERY repo (main only fast-forwards, tags are add-only),
#   - bypasses hooks (--no-verify, or a core.hooksPath override), or
#   - targets `main` directly (main advances ONLY via an agent-validated PR
#     merge). A bare `git push` with no refspec is left to the server-side
#     branch protection, the authoritative block.
#   Local `git commit --amend` is NOT gated — amending a branch is a normal
#   authoring action, legal until the branch's first push. What IS gated is the
#   FORCE-PUSH a later amend would need to deliver, forbidden on every branch
#   (a pushed branch advances only by adding commits).
# Shares git-command parsing with pre-commit-gate via gitcmd.py; obfuscation is
# out of scope by construction (see gitcmd.py / /charly-internals:agents).
#
# Fast path: only a git-push-mentioning command reaches the analyzer.
