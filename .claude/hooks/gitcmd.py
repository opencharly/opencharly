"""Shared git-command inspection for the pre-commit and pre-push PreToolUse gates.

These gates are DISCIPLINE BACKSTOPS, not security boundaries: every change is
re-validated by a fresh pr-validator agent and by GitHub branch protection. This
parses the common, honest command forms and does NOT try to defeat deliberate
obfuscation (splitting the command word, generating it at runtime) — an infinite
regress no static parser wins, and the server's job.

`git_invocations` TOKENIZES with shlex (posix, punctuation_chars) so a quoted
argument containing a space is one token (the fail-open a bare regex has), splits
on shell separators so a compound `… && …` does not bleed one command's args into
another, and raises `ValueError` when the command cannot be tokenized — an
UNBALANCED or UNQUOTED quote (e.g. an apostrophe in a heredoc body, or an
unterminated `"`). A CLEAN heredoc tokenizes fine and is judged normally; it is
the stray quote, not the heredoc, that fails. The caller MUST fail closed on that
ValueError via `mentions_subcommand` — returning "no command" there is how a gate
silently stops gating.
